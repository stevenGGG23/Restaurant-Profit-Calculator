Designed to calculate a receipt for a shop that sells various food items. Here's a detailed breakdown of what the code does:

Functionality Overview
Item Prices: The program defines constant prices for several menu items:

Mushrooms: $0.80
Lembas: $3.00
Cram Bread: $2.00
Salted Pork: $2.25
Rabbit Stew: $3.25
Honey Cake: $2.00
Well Water: $1.25
Input Collection: It prompts the user to enter the quantity sold for each item. The user is asked:

How many Mushrooms were sold?
How many Lembas were sold?
How many Cram Bread were sold?
How many Salted Pork were sold?
How many Rabbit Stew were sold?
How many Honey Cake were sold?
How many Well Water were sold?
Total Revenue Calculation: The program calculates the total revenue for each item by multiplying the quantity sold by the item's price. It sums these values to determine the overall revenue generated from all sales.

Cut Calculation:

A cut percentage of 6.75% (0.0675) is defined, representing the portion taken by the shop.
The program calculates the cut amount by multiplying the total revenue by the cut percentage.
It then calculates the total revenue after the cut by subtracting the cut amount from the total revenue.
Pre-Cut Profit: The program computes the pre-cut profit by dividing the total revenue by 2, which seems to imply a specific profit-sharing or calculation logic.

Receipt Printing: Finally, the program prints a formatted receipt, which includes:

The shop name
The quantities and names of each dish sold
The unit price of each dish
The total received for each dish
The overall total revenue, cut taken, total after cut, and pre-cut profit
In summary, the program serves as a basic point-of-sale system for a shop selling food items, allowing the owner to input sales data, calculate totals, and print a receipt in a structured format. It can be expanded with features like input validation, error handling, and more detailed sales reporting.
